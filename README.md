# KAU Hospital System - Project Overview

## Introduction
The KAU Hospital System is a simulation software designed to manage hospital operations such as registering rooms, doctors, nurses, and patients. It assigns rooms and doctors to patients, manages medication distribution, and generates detailed billing reports.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Registration**: Handles the registration of hospital rooms, medical staff, and patients.
- **Dynamic Assignment**: Dynamically assigns rooms, doctors, and medications to patients based on system inputs.
- **Billing and Reporting**: Generates detailed billing reports for each patient, including charges for room, doctor consultation, and medications.

## Technical Requirements

- **Data Management**: Uses arrays to manage data related to rooms, medicines, and personnel.
- **File I/O**: Reads input from `input.txt` and writes outputs to `Output.txt`, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implements concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and object passing to structure the software effectively.

## Objective

To demonstrate the application of advanced object-oriented programming concepts in creating a functional hospital management system. This project serves as a practical example of handling complex data structures and file operations in software development.

## How to Use

- **Initialization**: Load initial data from `input.txt` to set up the system with default values for rooms, medicines, and personnel.
- **Operation**: Process commands from the input file to manage assignments and generate billing.

This README provides a clear guide to setting up and using the KAU Hospital System, suitable for educational purposes or further development.

Explore the code to understand the implementation of object-oriented principles and file handling in a real-world application scenario.
